State Lifting...
We all know that through props we can share data from parent component to child component
along with data we can share function childrens etc it makes state management very easy but what if 
we have to share data along sibling or from child to parent now here State shifting comes in 
picture this concept help with solving above condition... for that we simple create all the states in
parent and pass that state and function to manage that state as a prop to children so that eny changes 
in child on the passed state will automatically reflect in parent and sibling also or simply We
can say that we are doing state sinking.
