React is Library use to create a single page website and update UI dynamically and follow component 
based architecture. Now to create multiple Route and handle these route react-router-dom is used
this module provide functionality to create browser route and access them easily

along with this React provide several ways to access these routes or to create a Navbar.
In previous section to manage routing we used anchor tag but the major disadvantage with anchor tag 
that is refreshes entire page to redirect at desired route so to prevent this we use Link tag or
navlink Tag but for this functionality React also provide a hook named usenavigate help in 
conviniently routing to different pages. 

Along with all these React also provide a hook named useparam this hook help to access
route parameters.

Nested Routing is also a very important concept that allow to design route with multiple children component
