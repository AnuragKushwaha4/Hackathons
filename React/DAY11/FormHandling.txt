In traditional React form handling, we use controlled components where each input field is 
connected to state using useState. Every time the user types, the state updates and the 
component re-renders.

While this works fine for small forms, in large forms it may cause unnecessary 
re-renders and impact performance.

React Hook Form is a lightweight library that uses uncontrolled components 
and refs internally. It minimizes re-renders and improves performance. It provides a
 useForm hook to handle form registration, validation, submission, and error handling efficiently.
